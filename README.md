# 🚀 Frontend Intern Task: Pixel-Perfect Landing Page (React + Vite + Tailwind)

## 📌 Task Title:
**Landing Page Development — Pixel-Perfect Figma to React (Vite + Tailwind)**

---

## 📝 Task Description:
You are required to build a **fully responsive landing page** using **React with Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**, based **exactly on the shared Figma design**. The objective is not just functionality, but **precision**—every detail must match the Figma 1:1.

You are expected to complete **as many sections as possible** from the Figma file within the given timeline. **Quality and accuracy over quantity.**

👉 **Figma Design Link:** [Open Figma]( https://www.figma.com/design/0JHO2KmyVs6a0G2SidMC6j/Diicent-Task?node-id=1-2&t=HGTuP8wNcjGZ2Atw-1 )

## ✅ Task Requirements:
- Use **React + Vite** as the development framework.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for all styling.
- Build only the components/pages visible in the Figma file.
- Ensure your code is **clean, modular, and readable**.
- The page must be **responsive**, matching Figma’s desktop and mobile layouts (if provided).
- The final UI should be **pixel-perfect** — fonts, colors, paddings, spacings, alignments, shadows, and other visual properties must match **exactly** with Figma.
- Create **reusable and semantic components** (e.g., `Button`, `Navbar`, `Card`, etc.).
- **Do not use external component libraries** like MUI, Bootstrap, etc.
- All assets (fonts/images/icons) must be **extracted from Figma** and used properly.

## 📁 Folder/Code Structure Guidelines:
```bash
src/
├── assets/         # Images, icons, fonts from Figma
├── components/     # Reusable components (Button, Navbar, etc.)
├── pages/          # Main page(s) like LandingPage.jsx
├── App.jsx
├── main.jsx
└── index.css       # Tailwind base config
```

---

## 🔍 Evaluation Criteria:
- 🔹 **Accuracy to Figma** (1:1 implementation)
- 🔹 **Code Quality** (clean, readable, componentized)
- 🔹 **Responsiveness**
- 🔹 **Usage of Tailwind best practices**
- 🔹 **No unnecessary code or unused files**
- 🔹 **Proper folder/component structure**
